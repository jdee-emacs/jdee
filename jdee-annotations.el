;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library tries to indent java annotations
;; (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html)
;; like the code examples listed in the webpage.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cc-mode))

See `c-set-offset' for a description of OFFSET and SYMBOL."

Also for method and class declarations instead of the field foo.
With statement-cont, indents local variables with annotations as above.
