  "Specify a common classpath for compile, run, and debug commands.
Use this variable if you want to the JDEE to use the same classpath for
compiling, running,and debugging an application. Note that the value
of this variable is a list of strings, each of which specifies a
path. The JDEE converts this list to a colon- or semicolon-separated
list before inserting in the compiler or vm command line.

The path may start with a tilde (~) or period (.) and may include
environment variables. The JDEE replaces a ~ with your home directory.
If `jdee-resolve-relative-paths-p' is nonnil, the JDEE replaces the
. with the path of the current project file. The JDEE replaces each
instance of an environment variable with its value before inserting it
into the command line.

You can specify different classpaths for compiling, running and
debugging applicaitons. Use `jdee-compile-option-classpath' to specify
the compilation classpath, `jdee-run-option-classpath' to specify the
run classpath, and/or `jdee-db-option-classpath' to specify the debug
classpath. You can use these variables together. For example, suppose
that you need to use one classpath for compilation and other for
running and debugging. You could do this by setting
`jdee-compile-option-classpath' to the compile classpath and
`jdee-global-classpath' to the run and debug classpath. If you set
`jdee-global-classpath', the JDEE uses it to construct the classpath for
any operation for which you do not set the operation-specific
classpath variable (e.g., `jdee-compile-option-classpath').

If you do not set `jdee-global-classpath', the JDEE uses the operation-specific
classpath if it is set. If neither the global nor the
operation-specific classpath is set, the JDEE does not generate a
-classpath argument for the operation, e.g., compile or run a Java
class. In this case, the operation uses the value of the CLASSPATH variable
if specified."
