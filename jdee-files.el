  "This function performs the following transformation on PATH:

  * Replaces environment variables of the form $VAR or ${VAR} with
    their values. Note that you must use the Unix notation for
    environment variables on the native Windows versions of Emacs and
    XEmacs.

  * Replaces the tilde character with the value of the home directory,
    typically specified by the HOME environment variable.

  * Converts Cygwin style paths to DOS notation on Windows.

  * Converts relative paths to absolute paths if
    `jdee-resolve-relative-paths-p' is non-nil.  Paths are resolved
    according to the location of the deepest project file found, or if
    optional SYMBOL is non-nil, paths are resolved to the location of
    the deepest project file found that defines SYMBOL.

Note: PATH can either be a path string or a symbol corresponding to a
variable that holds a path string, in which case the optional arg
SYMBOL is unnecessary."
