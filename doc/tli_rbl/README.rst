===========================
Java TreeView tliste V 6.15
===========================

Description
===========

This is apparently a library and an applet (``tli_rbl.jar``) for
displaying a graphical tree view.

It has been made by `Berthou.com <http://www.berthou.com/us/>`_,
probably a long time ago (the doc proudly mentions that it runs on
Java 1).

Usage in JDEE
=============

In the JDEE source code, it is used only in some html and xsl files of
the documentation, I guess to improve the visual appearance or for
navigation purposes.

We should remove it sooner or later while improving the existing
documentation.
